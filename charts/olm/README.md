# hOLMes

I created this chart to avoid having to deploy OLM with the `operator-sdk`

There are some "vulnerabilities" in this chart that I haven't gone looking into yet, but they seem to be related to the build environment. So I may end up making the OLM operator build in my own environment later on. Still not sure how much I want to do that though.
